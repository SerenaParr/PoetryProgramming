<h2> POEM EXCHANGE </h2>
<p> A few months ago I participated in a poem exchange via email in which I sent one poem out and 
received four in return. The text below separates out the stanzas of each of the five poems and jumbles them together. </p>
<p>The exercise was performed manually, as inspired by Dadaist poetry, the Cut-up Method and Lynn Cherny's work. </p>
<p><em></em>Source text: "Poem [Lana Turner has collapsed!]" by Frank Oâ€™Hara, "The Fourth Sign of the Zodiac" by Mary Oliver, 
"This Solitude of Cataracts" by Wallace Stevens, "Dreaming The Breasts" by Anne Sexton, and a poem of unknown origin. </em>

Which kept flowing and never the same way twice, flowing

How desperate I would be
<br />
<br />
Through many places, as if it stood still in one,
<br />
<br />
Mother, I put bees in my mouth

He wanted to feel the same way over and over. 
<br />
<br />
To keep on flowing. He wanted to walk beside it, 
<br />
<br />
Surrendering to the Brief Wonderous world of Wander.

I know, you never intended to be in this world.

Lana Turner has collapsed!

<br />
I ate you up.
